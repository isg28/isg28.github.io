        <p> The Nintendo Wii <strong>was released</strong> on November 19, 2006. 
         Therefore, it's been 17 years! </p>
        <p>This console <strong> created </strong> my childhood. <em> it's somehow still functional, thankfully. </em></p>
    
         <p> Even though this console is unfortuately discontinued, this Wikipedia 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii#:~:text=It%20was%20released%20on%20November,and%20Sony's%20PlayStation%203."

        provides more information about the WII.</p>
